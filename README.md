# Not-Operate-Not-Obvious
Code lines around NoNo experience.
Developments are always conducted in the same way :
A theoretical model developed on Mathcad. Presentation as html files.
A scketch for each arduino card check.
A processing scketch.

NoNo is built with:
Wood plates, threaded rods, nuts, screws.
Three DC motors, two wheels and a sphere at the front.
For electronics, two lidar, two imu, three arduino uno card and an adafruit card control engines. An optical barrier with a diode and a photo receiver.

You 'll find 
Arduino code to control lidar and optical barrier, IMU sensors and motors
Processing code to command the robot.
Those program lines are associated with the youtube chanel presentation.

As the control command possibilities are a lot as we can imagine.
NoNo is a kind of practical application around different methods.
